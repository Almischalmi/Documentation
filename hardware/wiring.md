## Wiring the system for stability

{% hint style="danger" %}
Without exaggeration, over **80%** of the **issues** raised on the support forum and Telegram group can be traced back to improper **wiring and/or shielding**. The reduce the load on the team, please make sure you have followed the instructions in this chapter, we will point you here **without** much explanation if we suspect your problem is power or shielding related.
{% endhint %}

While it may seem like you could just connect the WiFi adapter to one of the USB ports, supply power to the raspberry pi and go fly, it's not quite that simple.

Some lower power WiFi adapter such as the _TPLink 722n_ may work out that way, but others may not. If your WiFi adapter needs more power than it is able to draw from the Raspberry Pi USB port, you will see "interference" that isn't really interference, dropped video frames, and potentially sudden video blackout. **That could happen** _**during flight**_ **if you don't take some simple steps to avoid it**.

In addition, if the USB connection is briefly moved or subjected to vibration, it may cause the WiFi adapter to reset or disconnect from the system, just long enough to completely stop the connection between ground and air.

The solution for those kinds of problems is to solder power from a BEC or other 5v power supply, to the WiFi adapter\(s\).

It is also strongly recommended that you solder the USB data lines. On some WiFi adapters this is easy because they have ready to use solder pads, or have a mini-USB connector on the adapter \(in which case you don't have to solder anything to the adapter itself, just the other end of the cable\).

### General tips and guidelines

* use short wires
* use wires with at least 20AWG gauge \(0.5mmÂ²\)
* solder _**everything**_, avoid any USB cables or plugs without a latching mechanism
* use a quality **BEC** with at least **3A**
* consider adding low-ESR electrolytic **capacitors** near the **WiFi** adapters and the raspberry pi
* **do not** use USB power banks
* **do not** use the micro USB connection on the raspberry pi for power
* **do** power the raspberry pi through the GPIO pins or by soldering power to the underside of the board
* **do** make sure the camera cable is properly seated on both ends
  * On the raspberry pi zero, the camera connection is not very secure, especially if you have connected and disconnected it many times
  * You can secure the camera cable with some tape or a drop of hot glue
* **do** make sure the raspberry pi and WiFi adapters don't get hot
  * Consider adding small heat sinks, but be sure they will remain firmly attached with strong thermal tape
* Keep the antenna away from the camera and camera cable
* If you see **straight vertical** **lines** in the video, you may need to use a **shorter** camera cable or **shield** it with foil
* The system can potentially interfere with 433Mhz, 868Mhz LRS, or GPS
  * If you encounter problems like this, consider separating, shielding or changing some of the components \(ask us for help\)

## Power wiring

### Ground

Much like the Air SBC, the Ground SBC will likely be powered by a LiPo battery. The Raspberry Pi and the WiFi cards all use 5V, which is what most ESC's produce. So hook up one of your SBC's to a LiPo battery and use a multi meter to double-check the output is +5V.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Raspberry Pi and most WiFi adapters actually like the voltage to be slightly higher than +5V, along the lines of 5.2V ~ 5.4V. If you have a variable output, best set it to +5.3V. Do not go higher than +5.4V or you will damage your Raspberry Pi and/or WiFi cards!
{% endhint %}

When you have verified the output of the ESC, we can connect it to the Raspberry Pi, to do this, we have two options. Soldering or using the GPIO Pin Header, for the Ground SBC it's OK to use the GPIO Pin Header, for the Air unit we recommend soldering. Connect the output from the ESC to the PI on pins 2 and 6 \(or 4 and 6\) according to this diagram:

This can be done easily by just plugging in the Servo header that comes with most ESC's into the Raspberry Pi Pin Header. Make sure the RED wire is connecting to Pin 2 or 4 and the BLACK wire is connecting to PIN 6. Now when you connect power to the ESC, the Raspberry Pi will power up!

The 3A BEC can also power a 7" HDMI screen with a micro USB connector.

Now that we have power going to the Raspberry Pi it's time to power the WiFi adapter\(s\). Due to the way the Raspberry Pi is designed the USB ports do not receive enough power to drive the WiFi cards, especially when connecting more than one WiFi card as is often the case on a ground station.

To mitigate this problem it is necessary to power the WiFi card\(s\) directly from the ESC as well. Please refer to the diagram below to see how. Please note that **5V** and **GND** are **NOT** connected to the Raspberry Pi USB Port.

Soldering as much of these connections as possible will prevent accidental disconnects. On the Ground side, soldering might be optional, on the Air side it is mandatory as it is subjected to greater vibrations.

### Air

Much of the explanation for the Ground wiring also applies to the Air, except that where it is likely no problem to use USB adapters on the Ground, using them in the Air will absolutely cause problems. It is therefore absolutely recommended to solder as much as possible in the Air setup and if you want to use connectors, please use connectors that can withstand the vibrations and stresses of being in a vehicle.

JST connectors can be used as they lock into place and these can be had for quite cheap. The 4 pin variant can be used to replace the standard USB cords.
